# AGENTS.md — How the Internet Works (interactive educator)

Guidance for AI agents and humans working on this repo. Read this before changing code.

## What this is

An interactive web page that shows what really happens when a laptop fetches `http://example.com/`. The user drags a URL card into a laptop; a **protocol-accurate simulation** runs (ARP → DNS over UDP → TCP handshake → HTTP GET → response → FIN teardown) across a map of devices (laptop → home router with NAT → ISP router → DNS resolver / web server), and the UI animates every frame as byte blocks moving between devices, being wrapped and unwrapped layer by layer.

Audience: CS-student level. Visually clean by default, with pause-and-expand for full detail.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Protocol realism.** Every byte shown is a real byte the simulation produced: real header layouts, real field values, real checksums (IPv4, UDP, TCP pseudo-header, Ethernet CRC-32). Never fake a field for the UI. If a teaching need conflicts with realism, expose a *real* knob (e.g. MSS 1460/536) instead of inventing data.
2. **`src/sim` is headless and deterministic.** It must not import from `src/ui`, GSAP, or touch `window`/`document`/`Date`/`Math.random`. ESLint enforces this. All randomness goes through the seeded `Rng` (`src/sim/core/Rng.ts`).
3. **The UI only renders the event log.** The UI never decides protocol behaviour. It reads `SimResult` (events, PDU snapshots, packets) and animates it. "Lose this packet" re-runs the sim with a `FaultPlan`; it does not patch the animation.
4. **Receivers decode bytes.** Devices parse incoming bytes with the same codecs the inspector uses; nothing trusts sender-side metadata.
5. **Every field has an explanation.** Each `Field` produced by a describer needs a non-empty `explain` (a test enforces it). Tag fields `importance: 'key'` (clean view) or `'detail'` (full/hex views).
6. **Animations must be reversible** (scrubbing backward). Tweens are pure from→to; DOM for strips is created at build time and toggled, not created in `onUpdate`.
7. **Graphics: simple shapes first** (SVG rects, circles, paths). If a richer illustration would help, write an image-generation prompt for the user (they generate it with ChatGPT) and leave an asset slot. Do not hand-draw complex art.

## Commands

The machine may not have Node on `PATH` in every shell. If `node` is missing in Git Bash, prefix with `export PATH="/c/Program Files/nodejs:$PATH";`.

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server |
| `npm test` | Vitest (sim core + codecs) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (incl. sim/UI boundary) |
| `npm run build` | typecheck + static build to `dist/` |
| `npx vite-node scripts/dump-events.ts [mss] [lose:<packetId>@<linkId>]` | Print a scenario's full event log (debugging) |
| `node scripts/capture-example-com.mjs` | Re-capture the real example.com response (regenerates `src/sim/scenarios/exampleComCapture.ts` and `tests/fixtures/*.http`) |

Run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` before declaring work done.

## Key concepts

- **Packet vs. PDU snapshot.** A `PacketInfo` is a logical packet (`pk12`, label "SYN"). It keeps its id across hops. A `PduSnapshot` (`pdu40`) is the exact bytes at one moment (e.g. the frame on one link). Every `encapsulate`/`decapsulate`/`tx`/`forward`/`nat:translate` event points at a snapshot. Retransmissions are new packets with `retransmitOf`.
- **Layer numbers** in the sim are TCP/IP 5-layer (1 physical … 5 application). The UI maps to OSI names when that setting is on.
- **Stream packets** (`kind: 'stream'`) are application bytes handed to TCP or reassembled from it; they never cross a link.
- **Determinism / faults.** Same scenario + seed + FaultPlan ⇒ identical event log. Random loss is keyed by `hash(seed, link, packet)` so adding a manual fault never changes events before it (tested).

## How to add things

- **A new protocol:** add `src/sim/proto/<p>.ts` with `build`, `parse`, `describe` (absolute offsets, explanations), wire it into `decode.ts`, add the name to `Protocol` and `PROTOCOL_LAYER`, add codec tests with known-good bytes.
- **A new scenario:** add `src/sim/scenarios/<name>.ts` returning a `Scenario` (devices with ifaces/routes/ARP seeds/apps/layout, links with real-ish speeds and delays). Add app behaviour in `stack/apps.ts` if needed. Add narration for any new event/app action in the UI. Add a test in the style of `src/sim/run.test.ts`.
- **A new event type:** add it to `SimEventPayload`, emit it from the sim, then handle it in the UI choreography and narration.

## Real-world facts and simplifications (keep honest)

- example.com resolves to Cloudflare addresses; captured values live in `src/sim/scenarios/exampleComCapture.ts` (re-capture with the script). The HTTP response is the verbatim captured bytes (chunked, 932 bytes as of 2026-10-29).
- Home public IP `203.0.113.7` and ISP backbone `198.51.100.0/24` are RFC 5737 documentation ranges standing in for real ones. MAC addresses are plausible but invented.
- The laptop behaves like Linux: TTL 64, ephemeral ports 32768–60999, SYN options MSS/SACK-permitted/timestamps/NOP/window scale 7, glibc DNS timeout 5 s × 2 attempts. TCP RTO follows RFC 6298 (1 s minimum).
- Simplifications to state in the UI: the real internet path has ~10 routers, we show one ISP router; the resolver answers from cache (no recursive lookup shown); the LAN is wired Ethernet (Wi-Fi uses 802.11 framing); no IPv6, no TLS in this scenario; ACKs are sent immediately (Linux "quickack" at connection start), not delayed.
